## Specification of Propositional Logic

We begin by reproducing our formal specification
of the syntax and semantics of propositional logic,
without distracting test cases, implementation 
alternatives, or explanatory text.

## Review and Practice

### Propositions

A proposition is an expression that asserts that
some *state of affairs* holds in some world, real 
or imaginary. It makes sense to ask whether a given
proposition is true or false in some world.

Here's an example of a proposition: "The red block 
is on top of the blue block." It makes sense to ask,
"Is it true that the red block is on top of the blue
block?" However, to answer this question, we also
have to specify a *world* in which we are to evaluate
it truth or falsity.

For example, imagine two children, say Bob and Sally,
each playing with blocks. We can ask "Is it true that
the red block is on top of the blue block *in Sally's
world?*" We can ask "Is it true that the red block is
on top of the blue block *in Bob's world?*" And we may
well get different answers. We evaluate the truth of 
a proposition in a specified world.

### Propositional Logic

There are many different logics. Each provides a
*language* of propositions, different kinds of worlds,
and formal methods for assessing the truth of a given 
proposition in a given world.

Propositional logic is an especially simple logic.
It provides a language of *atomic propositions*, a
way of building larger propositions by combining 
smaller ones (using the not (¬), and (∧), or (∨), 
implies (⇒), and equivalence (↔) connectives, and 
a recursive function for evaluating the truth of an
expression given (a world) a function that assigns
Boolean values to each propositional variable that
might appear in the proposition. 

### Variables Represent Atomic Propositions

In propositional logic, one represents an atomic 
proposition using a variable name. For example,
one could represent the atomic proposition, *The 
red block is on top of the blue block* using the
variable, *red_block_on_blue_block*. Similarly,
one could represent the atomic proposition, *The
yellow block is on the red block* using the rather
verbose variable, *yellow_block_on_red_block*. 

### Larger Propositions Are Built Using Connectives

We could then write the larger proposition, *The red
block is on the blue block AND the yellow block
is on the red block* as *red_block_on_blue_block
∧ yellow_block_on_red_block*. More generally, we
can form larger propositions by applying logical
*connectives* such as ¬, ∧, and ∨, to (the right 
number of) smaller propositions, bottoming out at 
atomic propositions.  

### Abstracting to Short Variable Names

Using long and expressive variable names makes 
larger propositions hard to write and read. The 
usual practice, then is to use single character 
variable names to represent atomic propositions. 

Here for example we might just use *r* to represent 
the *red on blue* proposition and *y* to represent
the *yellow on red* proposition. Now we can write 
the concise, formal expression, *r ∧ y*, to stand
for the proposition that *The red block is on the 
blue block *and* the yellow block is on the red 
block*. In practice one could provide an informal 
translation table linking short variable names to 
their intended natural language meanings. 

| variable |      intended meaning        |
|----------|------------------------------|
|    r     |  red block is on blue block  |
|    y     | yellow block is on red block |

### Abstracting from Real-World Meanings 

The underlying purpose of a logic is to provide a
way to express propositions in such a way that we
can then reason about their truth or falsity using
only the rules of logic, without further reference 
to their intended informal meanings. We translate 
natural thoughts into mathematical representations
(logic) then use the mathematics to reason further, 
and finally we can translate logical conclusions
back into natural world meanings at the end of the 
process.

### Validity and Unsatisfiability

Furthermore, when studying logic, we are often 
interested in whether a given proposition in true
or false *independent of the meanings of its parts*.
For example, in propositional logic, the proposition,
*r ∧ ¬r* cannot be true no matter what natural language
proposition *r* means: as a proposition cannot be true 
and false. We call such a proposition *unsatisfiable.*

Similarly, the proposition, *r ∨ ¬r* is always true
in propositional logic: as a proposition can *only*
be true or false, and in either case one of the two
sub-expressions will be true, so the overall one will
be true as well. We call such a proposition *valid*.

For numerous reasons, then, we'll usually use single
letters to represent (natural language) propositions,
and moreover, we'll often do so without referring to
any particular natural language translations. That is,
we'll study logic *in the abstract*. When we show that
an abstract proposition is valid, then we can plus in
any informal meanings we want for the variables and we
still still have logically correct statements.

Consider, for example, the valid abstract proposition,
*A ∧ B ⇒ A.* Now suppose *A* means "the cat is old" and
B means "the dog is a puppy." Then the logical statement
means *if the cat is old AND the dog is a puppy THEN the
cat is old.* Valid propositions thus emerge as *general*
principles for logically sound reasoning, no matter what
the atomic propositional variables are defined to mean.

## HOMEWORK: 

Refer to each of the problems in HW5, Part 1. 
For each one, express the proposition that each function
type represents using our formal notation for propositional
logic. We'll take you through this exercise in steps. 
-/

/-!
### #1. Propositional Variables

First, define *b, c,* *j,* and *a* as propositional variables
(of type *var*). We'll use *b* for *bread* or *beta*,* *c* for 
*cheese,* *j* for *jam,* and *a* for α*. 
-/
def b := var.mk 0
def c := var.mk 2
def j := var.mk 1
def a := var.mk 3

-- get the index out of the c structure

#eval c.n

/-!
### #2. Atomic Propositions

Define B, C, J and A as corresponding atomic propositions,
of type *Expr*. 
-/
def B := {b}
def C := {c}
def J := {j}
def A := {a}

--  ((no jam) ⊕ (no cheese)) → (no (jam × cheese))





/-!
### #3. Compound Propositions

Now define the variables, e0 through e3, as expressions
in propositional logic using the concrete syntax we've 
defined.
-/

-- #1. ((no jam) ⊕ (no cheese)) → (no (jam × cheese)) 
def e0 := (¬J ∨ ¬C) ⇒ ¬(J ∧ C)
#eval eval_expr e0 (λ v => false)

-- YOU DO THE REST

-- (α → Empty ⊕ β → Empty) → (α × β → Empty)
def e1 := (¬A ∨ ¬B) ⇒ ¬(A ∧ B)
#eval eval_expr e1 (λ v => false)

-- (no (α ⊕ β)) → ((no α) × (no β))
def e2 := ¬(A ∨ B) ⇒ ((¬ A) ∧ (¬ B))
#eval eval_expr e2 (λ v => true)

--  ((no α) × (no β)) → (no (α ⊕ β)) 
def e3 := ((¬ A) ∧ (¬ B)) ⇒ ¬(A ∨ B) 
#eval eval_expr e3 (λ v => true)
/-!
### #4. Implement Syntax and Semantics for Implies and Biimplication
Next go back and extend our formalism to support the implies connective.
Do the same for biimplication while you're at it. This is already done 
for *implies*. Your job is to do the same for bi-implication, which
Lean does not implement natively. 
-/

/-!
### #5. Evaluate Propositions in Various Worlds

Now evaluate each of these expressions under the all_true and all_false
interpretations. These are just two of the possible interpretations so
we won't have complete proofs of validity, but at least we expect them
to evaluate to true under both the all_true and all_false interpretations.
-/

#eval eval_expr e0 (λ _ => false) -- expect true
#eval eval_expr e0 (λ _ => true)  -- expect true

-- You do the rest
#eval eval_expr e1 (λ _ => false)  
#eval eval_expr e1 (λ _ => true)  

#eval eval_expr e2 (λ _ => false)  
#eval eval_expr e2 (λ _ => true) 

#eval eval_expr e3 (λ _ => false)  
#eval eval_expr e3 (λ _ => true) 
/-!
### #6. Evaluate the Expressions Under Some Other Interpretation

Other than these two, evaluate the propositions under your new
interpretation, and confirm that they still evaluate to true.
Your interpretation should assign various true and false values
to *j, c, b,* and *a.* An interpretation has to give values to
all (infinitely many) variables. You can do case analysis by
pattern matching on a few specific variables (by index) then 
use wildcard matching to handle all remaining cases.

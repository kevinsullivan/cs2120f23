# Predicates

You've seen that in predicate logic, a proposition is a
declarative statement that asserts that some state of affairs
holds in some domain of discourse. For example, *the natural
number, four, is an even* is a proposition. We've seen one
way to formalize such a proposition using the mod operator.
-/

#check 4 % 2 = 0

## Families of Propositions

Indeed, there is an infinite family of propositions, all just
like this on~`e except for the particular number we plug in instead
of four. As another example, *the natural number, five, is even*
is also a proposition. And there's one such proposition for each
and every natural number.

We can write this family of propositions by *abstracting* the value,
four, to a variable: e.g., *the natural number, n, is even*, where
*n* can be any natural number. Now we have a predicate. Applying it
to a specific number then returns a proposition about that number.

We could say that applying the predicate, *the natural number, n,
is even*, to the specific number, four, returns the *proposition*,
*the natural number, four, is even.*

In Lean and related logics, we represent a predicate as a
*function:* from one or more parameter values to propositions.
Here's our simple example reformulated.
-/

def is_even : Nat → Prop := λ n => n % 2 = 0
#check is_even 4
#reduce is_even 4
#check is_even 5

/-!
You can see that is_even is a predicate by checking its type.
Indeed, it's a function from a natural number to a proposition
*about* that number: namely that the given number mod two is
zero. The type of our predicate is thus *Nat → Prop*.
-/
#check (is_even)      -- Nat → Prop

/-!
## Applying a Predicate to Arguments Yields a Proposition

Given a predicate we derive a proposition by *applying* it to one
or more arguments of the specified types. The *is_even* predicate
is appliable to a natural number as an argument. Here are two examples
applying the is_even predicate.
-/

#check is_even 4
#check is_even 5
/-!
Note that Lean reduced n%2 in each case to 0 or 1, leaving us
with simpler propositions involving just 0 and 1.

## To Satisfy a Predicate
We will say that specific parameter values *satisfy* a predicate
if they yield a proposition that is true. In a sense, a proposition
thus specifies a *property* (such as that of being even) that a value
might or might not have. For example, four has the property of being
even but five doesn't.

## Predicates Specify Properties

In this way a predicate picks out the subset of parameter values with
a specified *property*. As an example, we can make a list of natural
numbers from 0 to 5, apply *is_even* to each, determine which resulting
propositions are true, and thus *pick out* the natural numbers with the
property of being even.

#reduce is_even 0   -- ✓
#reduce is_even 1   -- ×
#reduce is_even 2   -- ✓
#reduce is_even 3   -- ×
#reduce is_even 4   -- ✓
#reduce is_even 5   -- ×

/-!
Indeed, as we'll see in more depth shortly, we can understand
the *set* of all objects having a particular property as those
objects that satisfy the predicate that specifies the property.
In Lean, we can specify the set of even numbers as follows, and
*evens* here becomes nothing but a shorthand for is_even. We'll
see more of this top when we get to lectures on set theory.

def evens : Set Nat := { n | is_even n }
#reduce evens 4
#reduce evens 5

## Predicates of Multiple Arguments

Predicates can take any number of arguments. Here are some examples.

### Ordered pairs of numbers and their squares
-/

def square_pair : Nat × Nat → Prop
| (n1, n2) => n2 = n1^2

#reduce square_pair (1, 1)   -- ✓
#reduce square_pair (2, 4)   -- ✓
#reduce square_pair (3, 9)   -- ✓
#reduce square_pair (5, 20)  -- ×

def square_pairs : Set (Nat × Nat) := { p : Nat × Nat | square_pair p }
#reduce square_pairs (3, 9)
#reduce square_pairs (3, 10)
#reduce (3, 9) ∈ square_pairs

/-!
Here it is again but with two arguments rather than one pair.
This material is new relative to that presented in class. Take
an extra few minutes to study the precise differences in syntax
and sense between these two examples. In one, separate arguments
are packed into pairs, whereas in the second, they're not. They're
disaggregated.
-/
def square_pair' : Nat → Nat → Prop
| n1, n2 => n2 = n1^2

#reduce square_pair' 1 1   -- ✓
#reduce square_pair' 2 4   -- ✓
#reduce square_pair' 3 9   -- ✓
#reduce square_pair' 5 20  -- ×

def square_pairs' : Set (Nat × Nat) := { p : Nat × Nat | square_pair' p.1 p.2 }
#reduce square_pairs
#reduce (3, 9) ∈ square_pairs

/-!
When we specify multi-argument predicates our practice
is to present the arguments one by one in disaggregated
form. Among other things we can then more easily partially
evaluate the function on any one of its actual parameters.

### Pythagorean triples
-/

def pythagorean_triple : Nat → Nat → Nat → Prop
| h, x, y => h^2 = x^2 + y^2

#reduce pythagorean_triple 5 4 3

def py_trips : Set (Nat × Nat × Nat) := { t | t.1^2 = t.2.1^2 + t.2.2^2}

#reduce py_trips (5,4,3)

a *set* of objects of type *Person*. Make the Person type
inhabited by giving it the single constructor, Person.jim.

you don't know how to change the default constructor name,
*mk*, to *jim*.

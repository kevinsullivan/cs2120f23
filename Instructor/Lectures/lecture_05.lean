# Function Composition

We can now highlight first great generalization 
of this course: a function, we call it *compose*,
that combines any two *compatible* functions, *g*
and *f*, into a new function, denoted (g ∘ f), and
pronounced *g after f*, where for any *compatible* 
argument, *a*, *(g ∘ f) a* is defined as *g (f a)*. 
By *compatible* we mean that (1) *a* is the input
type of *f*, and (2) the *output* type of *f* is
the *input* type of *g*. When this is the case, 
we can provide *a* as an input to *f* and *(f a)* 
as an input to *g* to compute *g (f a)* as a final
result. In this chapter we build up from where we 
left off in the last chapter to a precise and general 
mathematical definition of function composition.

## Given f : α → α, apply2 returns (f ∘ f)
We start by further analyzing our polymorphic apply2 
function from the last chapter. Here it is again. 
-/

def apply2 {α : Type} : (α → α) → α → α
| f, a => f (f a)

/-!
Given any type, α (implicitly), *apply2* takes a 
function, *f : α → α*, and a value *a : α*, as its
arguments and returns the value of *f (f a)*. 

But given our definition of function composition, 
we can see that this result can also be written as
*(f ∘ f) a*: as we just defined (f ∘ f) a* to be 
nothing other than *(f (f a))*. Revisit the first
paragraph of this chapter to be sure that's clear.
-/

/-!
As an aside, here, again, are a few simple functions
from the last chapter, again, for use in examples to
follow.
-/

def double (n : Nat) := 2 * n 
def square (n : Nat) := n ^ 2
def exclaim (s : String) := s ++ "!"
def is_even (n : Nat) := n % 2 == 0

/-!
Now consider a simple application of apply2. 
Before reading any further, be sure that you
fully understand what it computes and how.
-/

#eval apply2 double 5   -- (double (double 5) 
                        -- (double ∘ double) 5
                        -- expect 20
/-!
Now consider how this expression is evaluated.
Remember: function application is left associative.
The expression, *apply2 double 5*, is thus evaluated 
as *(apply2 double) 5*. The expression *(apply2 double)* 
returns a *function* that then takes a next argument, 
such as 5, which it then doubles twice. Be sure you
see that *(apply2 double)* is a function. 
-/

#eval apply2 double 5     -- expect 20
#eval (apply2 double) 5   -- exactly the same 

/-!
Now a key question: what function is *(apply2 double)*?
Well, it's the function that, when applied to an argument,
*a,* applies double to it and then applies double to that
result. It's thus exactly the function, *(double ∘ double)*. 
Let's bind the name *double_after_double* to this function.
-/

def double_after_double := (apply2 double)

-- Sure enough it's a function from Nat to Nat
#check (double_after_double)

-- And it *behaves* just as expected
#eval double_after_double 0 -- expect 0  (double (double 0))
#eval double_after_double 1 -- expect 4  (double (double 1))
#eval double_after_double 5 -- expect 20 (double (double 5))

/-!
Leaving the final argument to be provided later,
we see that (apply2 double) is (double ∘ double).
More generally, given any type, α, apply2 applied 
to any function, *f : α → α*, returns the function,
*f ∘ f:* *f* composed with itself. 
-/

def square_after_square := apply2 square  -- square ∘ square
#eval square_after_square 5               -- expect 625

def exclaim_after_exclaim := apply2 exclaim -- exclaim ∘ exclaim
#eval exclaim_after_exclaim "Love math"     -- "Love math!!"

/-!
## Generalizing to Functions of Different Types

Of course, apply2 is a pretty limited mechanism for
composing functions: it can only compose a function,
f : α → α, with itself, to return *(f ∘ f)*. As you 
saw on the homework, we can also glue functions with
different types together, as long as the output type
of one is the same as the input type of the second. 

On the homework, we worked up to defining *glue_funs*
as a polymorphic function that, given any three types,
α, β, and γ, takes two functions, *g : β → γ* and *f :
α → β* along with any argument *a : α* and that returns 
*(g (f a))*, which we now understand to be *(g ∘ f) a*.
-/ 

def glue_funs {α β γ : Type} :
  (β → γ) →   -- type of g
  (α → β) →   -- type of f
   α →        -- type of a
   γ          -- result type
| g, f, a => g (f a)

/-!
Now, just as with *apply2*, if we leave off the third
argument, *a*, to *glue_funs*, we will get back exactly 
*(g ∘ f)*. That is, we'll get the function that, when 
applied to some argument, *a,* will return *(g (f a)).* 
What function does that? It's just *(g ∘ f)*.  
-/

#eval glue_funs square double 4   -- expect 64

-- Apply glue_funs to first two arguments
def square_after_double := glue_funs square double

-- Apply the resulting function to 4
#eval square_after_double 4       -- (square ∘ double) 4
                                  -- square (double 4)
                                  -- square 8
                                  -- 64

/-!
The square_after_double function *is* (square ∘ double).
Indeed, you even pronounce (square ∘ double) as *square
after double*. That makes sense because when you apply
(square ∘ double) to an argument *a* you apply *square*
after you apply *double* to *a*.
-/


/-!
Self-test: What is the type of the function returned 
by *glue_funs* when applied to two function arguments,
g : β → γ and f : α → β?
-/

/-!
Insight: glue_funs is a general function composition
operation! A better name for it is compose! We'll start
by calling it compose' and then make some improvements.

In this firt definition we've added explicit parentheses 
around *(α → γ)*. As → is right associative, doing this
leaves the meaning unchanged from above. This is just an
exact repeat of *glue_funs*. But with parentheses, the type 
of compose' reads better: it takes two functions, of types 
(β → γ) and (α → β), and returns a function of type (α → γ). 
That's it!
-/

def compose' {α β γ : Type} :
  (β → γ) →
  (α → β) → 
  (α → γ) 
| g, f, a => g (f a)


/-! 
Self-test: Using *compose'*, define a function,
is_even_len : String → Bool, that takes a string
and returns true if it's of even length and false 
otherwise.
-/

-- Answer here.

def is_even_len := _  -- Be sure you can solve it

#eval is_even_len "Love"    -- Expect true
#eval is_even_len "Love!"   -- Expect false
#eval is_even_len "Love!!"  -- Expect true

## Function (Also Known As Lambda) Expressions

Our code for *compose'* is a little more complex than
it needs to be. If all we're going to do is use it to
return functions, then (1) we don't expect to have to
give a third argument, *a*; and (2) we expect the type
of the return value to be a function type. Here's our
final definition of compose. It introduces a new idea:
that of anonymous function expressions. 
-/

def compose {α β γ : Type} :
  (β → γ) → 
  (α → β) → 
  (α → γ)       
| g, f => (fun a => g (f a)) 


/-!
Note that we've again written the type of compose
to emphasize that it takes two functions and returns
a function. We then match on the first two function
arguments, calling them *g* and *f*. Finally, what
we return is the value of a new kind of expression: 
(fun a => g (f a)). It specifies an unnamed function,
taking an argument, *a*, and returning the value of 
*g (f a)*. 

Such a function expression, often called a *lambda 
expression*, is defined in Lean by the keyword, *fun*
(you can also use a Greek lower case lambda, λ), then
arguments, then =>, then the expression that defines
the return value.  It's essential to understand that
such an expression defines a function: one that is
*waiting* for an argument *a* and that computes a
final result only then.

You can use a function expression anywhere you need
a function value. Here are some examples. 
-/

-- Here we give new names to old function friends
def fun_double := fun (n : Nat) => 2 * n
def fun_square := fun (n : Nat) => n ^ 2 

-- Here we pass an unnamed function to composee
#eval compose (fun (n : Nat) => n%2 == 0) String.length "Love!"


/-!
In Lean4, the *compose* function is *Function.compose*
and the infix notation, ∘, is a convenient way to apply
it.
-/

-- Composing functions with Lean infix notation for compose
def double_after_square := (double ∘ square)
def is_even_len'' := (is_even ∘ String.length)

#eval double_after_square 5       -- expect 50
#eval String.length "Hello Higher Mathematics!" -- 25
#eval is_even_len'' "Hello Higher Mathematics!" -- false


/-!
## Welcome to Higher Mathematics

We now have the first really big idea in this course. 
In elementary mathematics you've always had numbers
and ways to combine numbers into new numbers: using 
operators such as + and *. That is, you've always had 
an *algebra* with numbers as basic objects and + and * 
as *operators* that you can use to combine them. Now 
you have a *higher* algebra with functions as basic 
objects and composition (∘) an an operator, akin to 
addition or multiplication, to combine *functions* 
into new functions. 

Being able to understand, define, and apply the general
concept of function composition is a milestone in learning. 
You will use the concepts embedded in this chapter for the
rest of the semester. You should take some time to savor 
the beautifully concise and powerful concept developed here. 
Here it is again, expressed even more cleanly.

def compose {α β γ : Type} (g : β → γ) (f : α → β) := λ a => g (f a)

This definition gives names to all of the arguments
(before the colon); leaves the return type implicit, which 
Lean infers; and uses λ instead of fun (for the "fun" of it)
to write the function that this compose function is to return.
-/

/-!
## Extra, extra!
Did you know that Java and Python support lambda expressions?
Challenge: Write the compose function in Python and then use it to
replicate some of the concrete examples in this chapter. You will 
be a far better programmer for having done this. 

Lambda expressions, or *lambdas* as you'll hear them called, 
are used all over the place, especially in graphical user interface
code. For example, you can store a *lambda* (a function!) as a data
member inside a button object, so that when the user presses the 
button, that function is run to carry out a given task. Hint: Use
a generative AI to explore these ideas in Python.

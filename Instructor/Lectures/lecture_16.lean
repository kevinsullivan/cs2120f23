# Curry-Howard: Logic as Computation

ToDo: More explanation.

## Empty ↦ False
-/

/-!
### Empty

You've already met and understood the Empty data type.
-/

#check Empty
/-!
inductive Empty : Type
-/

/-!
As an example, here's another uninhabited type (in Type)
-/
inductive Chaos : Type

/-!
From an assumption that one has a value of type Empty,
anything can follow. We can even promise to return a
value of our new uninhabited type.
-/
def from_empty (e : Empty) : Chaos := nomatch e

/-!
### False

The *logical* analog of the Empty *data* type is the proposition,
False. It is an uninhabited type, but now in Prop. Such a type is
understood as representing a proposition. That there is no proof
of False---no value of this type---means that as a proposition it
is logically false.
-/

#check False
/-!
inductive False : Prop
-/

def from_false {P : Prop} (p : False) : P := False.elim p

def from_false_true_is_false (p : False) : True = False := False.elim p

-- no introduction rule, as there are no proofs of False


/-!
## Unit ↦ True

### Unit
-/

#check Unit
-- inductive PUnit : Sort u where
--  | unit : PUnit

/-!
### True
-/

#check True
/-!
inductive True : Prop where
| intro : True
-/

#check True.intro

-- no elimination rule

def proof_of_true : True := True.intro

/-!
Example
-/
def false_implies_true : False → Chaos :=
   λ f => False.elim f


/-!
## Prod ↦ And

### Prod
-/

#check Prod

/-
structure Prod (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  fst : α
  snd : β
-/

/-!
### And
-/

#check And
/-
structure And (a b : Prop) : Prop where
  intro ::
  left : a
  right : b
-/

-- Propositions as types, proofs as values
inductive Birds_chirping : Prop
| yep
| boo

-- Propositions as types, proofs as values
inductive Sky_blue : Prop
| yep


#check (And Birds_chirping Sky_blue)
#check (Birds_chirping ∧ Sky_blue)

theorem a_proof : Birds_chirping ∧ Sky_blue :=
  -- And.intro Birds_chirping.yep Sky_blue.yep
  ⟨ Birds_chirping.yep, Sky_blue.yep ⟩  --  notation

/-!
## On Proof Irrelevance

For the purpose of demonstrating that a given proposition
is true (or, more accurately, valid), any proof will do. All
proofs are equivalent in this dimension. In Prop, all proof
values are considered to be equal. Moreover, choices among
otherwise equivalent proofs aren't allowed to affect rsults
of computations.
-/

/-!
With values of data types, we care a lot about particular
values. There's a huge difference between *tre* and *false*
as values of the Boolean type,

Indeed, one of the fundamental rules of inductive *data*
type definitions (in Type or above) is that *constructors
are disjoint*. This means that different constructors always
create values that are different: unequal.
-/
inductive Bool : Type
| true
| false


/-!
But because Birds_chirping is in Prop (it's a proposition, right)
all of its values, all values accepted as proofs of the propisition,
are actually considered to be equal. You would understand the details
of the formal proof until we talk about equality, but you can trust
that Lean is accepting that there is a proof that boo and yep really
are *equal*.

-/
theorem proof_equal : Birds_chirping.boo = Birds_chirping.yep := by trivial

/-!

Major take-away: values of propositional types are not just
all equally acceptable as mathematical proof objects, they
are considered as all being literally *equal*. We will talk
about equality in more detail soon.
-/

/-!
## Sum ↦ Or

### Sum Data Type
-/

#check Sum

/-
inductive Sum (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  | inl (val : α) : Sum α β
  | inr (val : β) : Sum α β
-/

/-!
### Or Connective
-/

#check Or
/-
inductive Or (a b : Prop) : Prop where
  | inl (h : a) : Or a b
  | inr (h : b) : Or a b
-/

-- Two different proofs of the same proposition,
theorem one_or_other  : Or Birds_chirping Sky_blue := Or.inl Birds_chirping.yep
theorem one_or_other' : Or Birds_chirping Sky_blue := Or.inr Sky_blue.yep
example : one_or_other = one_or_other' := rfl -- the different proofs are equal
/-!
In some cases you'll need to select the disjuct for which you have a proof.
-/
example : Or Birds_chirping (0=1) := Or.inl Birds_chirping.yep  -- inr is no go
example : (0=1) ∨ (1=2):= _  -- no proof of either disjunct: false


/-!
We know have ample machinery to prove interesting theorems in
fundamental mathematical logic. As an example, we now state and
*construct a proof* of the proposition that *Or* is commutative.
Technically it's a biimplication, but the cases are symmetric
so we'll just consider one direction: if we assume that P and
Q are arbitrary propositions, then if the proposition P ∨ Q is
true (and we have a proof, poq) then we can derive a proof of
Q ∨ P, showing that it is true, and that our overall proposition
is *valid*. The proof of that is by case analysis
-/
theorem or_comm {P Q : Prop} : P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P :=
λ (poq : P ∨ Q) =>
  match poq with
  | Or.inl p => Or.inr p
  | Or.inr q => Or.inl q


/-!
## Negation

### no

When representing logical operations using computational
types (in Type), we represented the proof of a negation
of a proposition, α, as a function (implementation) from
(of type) α → Empty.

If there is a function of this type, then the type, α, must
be uninhabited: there are no proofs of it; so it is false
and the proposition ¬α is true. To prove ¬α, give a function
of type α → Empty. This is all of course when implementing
logical reasoning in using computational (Sum, Prod, Empty,
and other) types (in Type).
-/
def no (α : Type) : Type := α → Empty

/-!
Example. Recall we defined Chaos as uninhabited in Type.
This is how we model the notion that Choas is false. We
*no Chaos* literally means (the proposition-representing
function type) *Chaos → Empty.* What we do in this example
is to show that there is a value of this function type.
The function takes a Chaos value (proof) as an argument.,
for which an empty case analysis satisfies the obligation
of the function to return a value in each case.
-/
example : no Chaos := λ c => nomatch c

/-!

### Not(¬)

We'll now see that the approach is analogous in Prop, the
type Universe for logical reasoning in Lean. If P is any
proposition, then Not P (concrete notation, ¬P) is also a
proposition. It is true when P (the type of proofs of P) is
uninhabited.
-/
#check Not

/-!
def Not (a : Prop) : Prop := a → False

Compare this directly and carefully with how we defined
the corresponding concept, *no*, using computational types
and values (in or under Type).
-/

-- Computational
example : no Chaos := λ (c : Chaos) => nomatch c

-- Logical

-- A proposition with no proofs is false
-- Here then is a proposition, it's raining, that's false
inductive Raining : Prop

-- What's cool is that we can now prove it's negation (is valid)
example : ¬Raining := λ (r : Raining) => nomatch r
-- Compare this with a corresponding example in Type

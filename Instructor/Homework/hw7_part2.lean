## #1 Easy Functions [15 points]

Define a function, *pythag*, that takes three natural 
numbers, call them *a, b,* and *c*, and that returns
*true* if *a^2 + b^2 = c^2* and that returns *false*
otherwise.
-/

-- Define your function here


-- The following test cases should then pass
#eval pythag 3 4 5  -- expect true
#eval pythag 6 7 8  -- expect false

/-! 
## #2 Recursive Functions

Define a function, sum_cubes, that takes any natural
number, *n*, as an argument, and that retrns the sum
of the cubes of the natural numbers from *1* up to *n*
inclusive.
-/

-- Define your function here




-- test case: sum_cubes 4 = 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100
#eval sum_cubes 4   -- expect 100

## #3 Product and Sum Types

Define two functions, called *prod_ors_to_or_prods*, 
and *or_prods_to_prod_ors* that shows that a product 
of sums be converted into a sum of products in a way
that the result can then be converted back into the
original product of sums. 

As a concrete example, you might want to show that if 
you have an apple or an orange and you have a cup or
a bowl, then you have an apple and a cup or an apple
and a bowl or an orange and a cup or an orange and a
bowl. 

Hints: 1. Be sure you understand the reasoning before
you try to define your functions. 2. Use four cases. 3. 
Use type-guided, top-down programming, assisted by the
Lean prover to work out a solution for each case.

def prod_ors_to_or_prods {α β γ δ: Type} :
  (α ⊕ β) × (γ ⊕ δ) → α × γ ⊕ α × δ ⊕ β × γ ⊕ β × δ 
| _ => _
| _ => _
| _ => _
| _ => _

## #4 Propositional Logic Syntax and Semantics

Extend your Homework #7 solution to implement the
propositional logic *iff/equivalence* (↔) operator.
Note that Lean does not natively define the *iff*
Boolean operator. 
-/

/-!
Using our syntax for propositional logic, and the
variable names *A, O, C,* and *B*, respectively for
the propositions *I have an apple, I have an orange,
I have a cup,* and *I have a bowl* write a proposition
that having an orange or an apple and a bowl or a cup
is equivalent to having an apple and a bowl or an
apple and a cup or an orange and a bowl or an orange
and a cup.

Note: There's no need here to use our implementation
of propositional logic. Just write the expression 
here using the notation we've defined.

## #5 Propositional Logic Validity
At the end of your updated Homework #7 file, use our
validity checking function to check your expression
for validity, in the expectation that the checker will
determine that the expression is in fact valid.
